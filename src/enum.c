This is the main enumeration stuff for the core coset enumerator.

Note: many of the functions `borrow' the scanning code (R-style or C-style)
& the deduction processing code from one another.  We do this for speed
(wrapping things up in a function can carry a significant penalty, and
generality `costs') or because the code in not _exactly_ the same (be
warned!).  I sometimes don't bother commenting such copies as fully as I 
might; check all copies for the full details.  (This is a form of
distributed documentation!)

	int al0_apply(int cos, int *beg, int *end, Logic defn, Logic save)

	Apply coset cos to the word stored in beg...end.  If defn is true
	then definitions are made to complete the trace, and if save is
	true any definitions are saved on the deduction stack.  This
	routine is intended for `general' use during R-style scans, so it 
	does _not_ worry about fill-factors or short gaps, nor is there any
	limit on the number of definitions made.  It's main use is in the 
	subgroup generator & relators as generators phases (when defn 
	will be true, and save may be true or false). 

	If a finite `index' is obtained, this is the return value.  If an
	overflow occurs, 0 is returned.  Otherwise -1 is returned.

	Warning: cos _must_ be a valid (1...nextdf-1) & non-coincident 
	coset.  This routine must _never_ be called if the coincidence 
	queue is non-empty (i.e., all coincidences must have been fully
	processed).

	Note that a finite index is only correct if the table has no holes.

  any R-style applying without filling rows, we toggle it to false.  This 
  indicates that the table _may_ contain holes, and that the al0_upknh() 
  routine may need to be called before a finite index (due to knr = nextdf)
  is returned.  Any code anywhere which could cause empty table slots 
  should take care to ensure that rhfree is false.  Since rhfree is only
  invoked when checking a finite result due to knr = nextdf, its value if
  we get a result due to knh=nextdf is of no concern (here, the table is
  hole-free, since that's what knh means!).

  Instead of trying to be clever, and keeping a close watch on what the
  value of this should be at each point, we simply reset it at the start of
  any call(s) where the rfill control parameter is false.  The cost of 
  running _upknh() is no more than that of row-filling (although it's
  concentrated in one `lump'), since all table positions are checked in 
  both cases.  In fact, it will usually be less, since we can start the
  check at knh, we need not check rows that have become redundant, and we
  make no definitions.  Note that, even if row-filling is not needed (to
  obtain a finite index), it may still be beneficial to turn it on, since
  it may alter the definition sequence. */

  if (!rfill)
    { rhfree = FALSE; }

  /* Do the appropriate setup for the requested style.  Our main concern
  is whether or not to stack defns/dedns (isave flag) so that these can be
  tested against all edp, for C-style enumerations.  We also have to track
  whether or not we have done this over the course of an entire run; we use
  the cdapp flag for this.  This flag is similar in concept to the rhfree
  one, but is more difficult to manage, since it is `more expensive' to get
  it `wrong'.  Furthermore, saving & applying dedns is a 3-stage process, 
  and cdapp only tracks the first step.

  cdapp is static, and is primed to true.  Any time we _may_ make any table
  entries _without_ stacking them, we toggle it to false.  Whether or not
  the stacking (call to SAVED()) was successful is monitored by the global
  disded flag.  Whether or not all the stacked dedns have been processed is
  determined by the stack size (the global topded).  If knh=nextdf and all
  three stages were successful (ie, cdapp=TRUE & disded=FALSE & topded==-1)
  then the result is valid.  If not, then the actual index may be smaller
  than the `current' one (ie, nalive).  Since our table is guaranteed hole-
  free at this stage, the quickest check is to run an R-style scan (with 
  definitions & deduction stacking both off!) to move knr up to nextdf,
  perhaps finding some coincs along the way; this RA phase is the default
  action.

  The settings below prime isave & cdapp for the styles.  However, finer 
  control is needed since, for example, a (successful) CL phase forces
  cdapp back to true (provided further dedns _will_ be stacked (ie, isave
  is true)).  We use the switch at the end of the state machine's main
  loop to do this.  Note that we must be careful, since we can exit at any
  time and we must ensure that the status is valid for any continues or
  redos.  We err on the side of caution, so the RA phase may be done when
  it is not (formally) required.

  Note that in some styles we don't save deductions initially, since we do
  a C-style table lookahead at the point where we switch from R-style to 
  C-style (which effectively forces cdapp to true).  (We could also insist
  that _all_ dedns _are_ applied, and do a C-style lookahead at any point
  where we detect `missed' dedns.)  Of course, if the dedn stack is large
  enough, then we'll never lose dedn's; but we could end up having to
  process _very_ large dedn stacks, which can be expensive. */
