\section{Terminology}

Although \ace\ can accept either letters or numbers for group generators,
  we generally use letters, since these are much easier to understand.
(Unless you need more than $26$ generators, or are using some form of 
  automatically generated presentation, you should adopt the same
  convention.)
Lower-case letters denote generators, with inverses being denoted by either
  upper-case letters or negative superscripts; e.g., $ABab$ and
  $a^{-1}b^{-1}ab$ are equivalent.
We use $1$ to denote the identity element and/or the subgroup (i.e.,
  coset \#1).

\dots scanning, applying, closing.
\dots dead coset(s), compact(ion).
\dots $S_n$, $A_n$, $C_n$.
\dots $|X:Y|$ denotes index.

\section{History}

%Cosets were first defined and discussed, in abstract terms, by Galois and
%  Cayley.
The concept of a subgroup, and its cosets, has been known since the 
  beginnings of group theory.
One of the earliest (practical?) uses of cosets seems to have been by
  Moore \cite{Moo}, who gives presentations for $S_n$ \amp $A_n$ and
  proves them correct by, in effect, counting the $n$ cosets of 
  $S_n/S_{n-1}$ \amp $A_n/A_{n-1}$.
Dickson \cite[\S264]{Dic} presents a more accessible account, and 
  explicitly notes that ``these sets form a rectangular table''\kern-2pt.
%
To illustrate this, we paraphrase Dickson's proof for the case $S_4$.

Let $G_4$ be the abstract group
  $$ \langle b_1,b_2,b_3 \mid b_1^2,b_2^2,b_3^2,
       b_1b_3=b_3b_1, b_1b_2b_1=b_2b_1b_2,b_2b_3b_2=b_3b_2b_3 \rangle . $$
Now $S_4$ is generated by the transpositions $s_1=(12)$, $s_2=(23)$ \amp 
  $s_3=(34)$.
Putting $s_i=b_i$, $1 \le i \le 3$, we see that these transpositions 
  satisfy the defining relations of $G_4$.
So $S_4$ is a quotient group of $G_4$, and $|G_4| \ge |S_4| = 4! = 24$.

That $|G_4| \le 24$, and so $G_4 \cong S_4$, is proved by induction.
Let $G_3$ be the subgroup of $G_4$ generated by $b_1$ \amp $b_2$.
(The actual induction is on the $b_i$.
For our purposes, we'll simply assume that $|G_3| \le 6$.)
Now consider the cosets $O_4=G_3$, $O_3=G_3b_3$, $O_2=G_3b_3b_2$ \amp 
  $O_1=G_3b_3b_2b_1$.
We'll show that these four cosets are merely permuted by the $b_i$, so
  that the index $|G_4 : G_3| \le 4$; hence $|G_4| \le 24$, as required.

Obviously, $O_4b_3=O_3$, $O_3b_2=O_2$ \amp $O_2b_1=O_1$.
Since the $b_i$ are involutions, then $O_3b_3=G_3b_3b_3=G_3=O_4$.
Similarly, $O_2b_2=O_3$ \amp $O_1b_1=O_2$.
Since $b_1$ \amp $b_2$ generate $G_3$, then $O_4b_1=O_4b_2=O_4$.
Now, since $b_1$ \amp $b_3$ commute, then 
  $O_3b_1=G_3b_3b_1=G_3b_1b_3=O_4b_1b_3=O_4b_3=O_3$.
Now consider $O_1b_3=G_3b_3b_2b_1b_3=G_3b_3b_2b_3b_1$.
Since $b_2b_3b_2=b_3b_2b_3$, then this can be written as 
  $G_3b_2b_3b_2b_1=O_4b_2b_3b_2b_1=O_4b_3b_2b_1=O_1$.
In a similar manner, $O_1b_2=O_1$ \amp $O_2b_3=O_2$.
Our coset table (see Table~\ref{tab:dic}) is now complete, so 
  $|G_4 : G_3| \le 4$.
Note that each $b_i$ gives rise to the transposition $(O_iO_{i+1})$, and
  leaves the other cosets fixed.

The construction of a coset table was systematised and popularised by Todd
  \amp Coxter \cite{TC}.
The first computer implementation was that of Haselgrove in $1953$.
This, along with other early implementations, is described by Leech
  \cite{Lee3}.
Detailed accounts of the techniques used in coset enumeration can be found
  in \cite{CDHW,Hav,Lee,Neu,Sim}.
Formal proofs of the correctness of various strategies for coset
  enumeration are given in \cite{Men,Neu,Sim}.
