Add notes re hole check (UH) in ex002

Discussion re 32/64 bit data/address `problem' ...
Table organisation & access methods ...

Chapter on system/compiler specific `utilities'
Chapter on `post-processing' package

History: FORTRAN, TC ... 4.06, (A)CE 1.0 & 1.1, ACE 2xxx, ACE 3000,
  PACE, PEACE, ACE3001

Stuff from GAP & Magma manuals

The division into `notes' & `guru notes' is somewhat arbitrary,
  and ...

Discussion re the `table access' speed problem.

Add note to the effect that `pure c' yields a standard table!
Prove that a compact & standard table yields coset reps which :-
i) are Schreier (ie, have the prefix property)
ii) are in order (ie, length + column lex order)
iii) are minimal (ie, no shorter rep)

General note re some commands ?? ...
Add a note to `rc' to the effect that it is `delicate' and that the 
  result should be checked before use.
It may also have altered some of the parameters if it returns 
  unexpectedly.

Update examples to 3.001

Put in a section about the `big collapse' problem, `ded siz' & `ded mode'
  parameters, etc.
Also, some examples about dropping some/many dedns can be profitable.
However, still problem with deduction handling - all or nothing.
Possible parallelisation - see PACE.
Discussion of `types' for collapses - #sec coincs, #dedns, #dedns when
  processing dedn list _after_ collapse, etc.

Make a note of the fact that progress messages are activity based, in an
  attempt to standardise the amount of work (& hence the time interval)
  that each step represents.
It's pretty good (much better than the old system), but still leaves a bit
  to be desired.

- I'm not 100% sure that there's not a memory leak when doing a long series of
  runs, where the presentation is constantly being redefined; see nep.in, where
  the memory usage goes up (and down), but this could be due (in part) to the
  dedn stack being realloc'd
