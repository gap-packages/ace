This file documents the rewrite/upgrade from ACE 4.000 (version 4.0, release 00)
to ACE 41xx (ver 4.1, rel xx).  The aim is to leave the functionality unchanged,
while enabling reliable compiling and execution on a variety of systems, with a
variety of memory models, using the GNU gcc compiler.  Compilation, or cross-
compilation, of Windows executables is supported. 

pre-April 2014

Did lots of experiments with C99 types (ie, inttypes.h), Windows and 64-bit 
versions of cygwin and MinGW.  Got gcc's packed structs working on both unix and
Windows.  Refined the testX.c example programmes and their make files, to work
on all machines (if appropriate - cygwin supports POSIX, Windows does not).
Introduced the COPYING file and the MIT license (this is a permissive open
source license).

1-3 Apr 14

- moved over and archived the original Changes and Diary files, and started this
  file (Diary2)
- moved over the x3/x10/x3 *.h/*.c/*.inc files
- copyrighted & licensed the 3x*.h files, and changed ACEVER to 4.100
- copyrighted & licensed the 3x*.inc files, with a bit of comment editing
- expanded make.linux to build ACE 4.1

4 Apr 14

- reworked make.cygwin to build ACE 4.1 and to include all available compilers
- did some checking with "cygcheck" & "objdump -p"
- tinkered with make.linux
- copyrighted & licensed the 10x*.c files, with a bit of comment editing

5/6 Apr 14

- reworked al0.h to use int64_t etc for types and to replace B/S/C macros with
  PB/PS/PC (as PRId64 etc)
- replaced bigCT etc compiler constants with B64S32C40 etc
- reworked make.linux
- worked through all printf() uses of B/S/C to replace with PB/PS/PC
- added a cast to (Coset) to CT(...) in a printf() to prevent compiler whinging
- changed margins on (some) source lines to 80 cols

7-9 Apr 14

- reworked make.cygwin
- created build1.bash to make all 5 x compiler by 4 x memory model combinations,
  on my Dell 64-bit cygwin
- did some testing of executables (+DLL) on various Windows boxes: WinXP, Vista
  & Win7
- all seems to work 'as expected'
- tested actually memory usage of ace.XXX using Resource Monitor & Task Manager,
  all seems OK
- checked test4 timing rollover on XP/Vista.  CPS is 1000, so goes through 
  2147.5 & 4295 OK.

10/11 Apr 14

- added test8 to test gcc's built-in CPU type & support function()
- reworked test4 to also print hex version of clock() value
- reworked some make files
- did some testing on windows boxes

13/14 Apr3 14

- sorted stupid typo in al0_rslt(), from 5/6Apr
- reworked some comments in util0.c & enum.c
- removed unused function al0_nholes()
- tinkered with make files
- started on al0_clock()/_diff() reworking

15/16 Apr 14

- worked on CLK32/64 stuff in util0.c, added #error directive
- reworked B8S4C5 etc stuff in al0.h, added #error directive
- reworked make files 
- included CLK field in al2_opt() printout
- reworked comments in util0.c, al0.h & util2.c
- reworked test4.c to test0a.c, added to make files, and tested

18-23 Apr 14

- worked through all the *.h/*.c/*.inc files, sorting any typos, clarifying the
  comments and generally tidying-up
- added in and/or edited some of the .../demo/ scripts

23-27 Apr 14
- included & reworked the ex0a.c example
- included & reworked the ex0d.c example
- started work on the guide
- tidied up some of the .../demo/ files

28-30 Apr 14
- worked on ex0d.c example
- created test100.in demo file
- started on the ex1* examples

1-21 May 14
- finished all the exN* examples in src
- worked on the demo *.in examples, included \nocite{}'s in ace41.tex
- worked on the guide
- worked on all the make files
- added the hidden Deb[ug] command

22 May 14
- started testing/installing on all machines, instituted the tmp/ACE4100/x28458/
  etc 'distribution' system
- started collecting the Warnings.txt/Errors.txt files
- worked on helper bash files

23 May 14
- added some fflush(stdout) to main loops in cmdloop.c & enum.c in an attempt to
  ameliorate the buffered o/p on, eg, Windows
- recorded, but did not use, the return value of the system() call, to prevent
  compiler warning (NO: it then complains re unused variable)
- LAST CHANGE to any of the source code; ie, src/*.{h|c|inc} files

6Jun14 - started using UQ's HPCU (ie, barrine) for some tests
9Jun14 - started work on manual

15-17 Aug 14
- first pass on the stuff to build the ace4100 directory tree; ie, the
  distribution
- reworked some of the demo/*.in files
- reworked some of the src/make.* files

18 Aug 14
- did some basic tests of make.linux/cygwin/cmd to check nothing was broken
