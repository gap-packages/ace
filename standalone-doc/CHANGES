##  Just `detailing' (to some extent) the various changes I've made to
##  the various files in this directory ... hopefully, most changes are
##  for the better; but you know to blame me if they aren't!

Changes to Stand-alone documentation:

29 Feb, 2000 [ These changes by Greg Gamble ]:

 * Added headers to each .tex/.cls/.clo/.bib file and to this file
   ... so that they could explicitly be listed with a version no.
       at the GAP4 CVS repository

28 Feb, 2000 [ These changes by Greg Gamble ]:

 * back.tex : added section `Groups notation'
              [G : H] now represents the set of right cosets of H in G
              ## George will hate me for that ... but I really can't live
              ## with the G/H notation that suggests `quotient' when it 
              ## ain't one
 * al2.tex : Table 3.2 changed each `n' to `0' and each `y' to `1' in table body
               ... was there a reason for using `y' and `n'?
             Replaced `/' notation for cosets, by plain English
             Added a glossary of possible parameter values to 3.3 Commands.
             Moved the BNF for <words> from section 3.3.28 group relators to
               3.3 Commands
             Put angle brackets around all `int's etc. in keeping with the
               glossary of 3.3 Command
 * pt.tex : Replaced `. / .' notation for cosets, by `[ . : . ]'.
            In 6.1 Example (4th paragraph) added sentences/clauses:

              - Cosets appear as subscripts.
              - ... $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ are cosets at some stage of an
                enumeration and ...
              - ...; the meaning of this proof word is:
                $\beta A=\alpha, \alpha C=\gamma, \gamma Cab = \gamma$
          
 * biblio.tex : added books by - Coxeter & Moser
                               - Magnus, Karrass & Solitar

3 Jan, 2000 [ These changes by Greg Gamble ]:

 * Directory of Stand-alone documentation changed from `acedoc'
   to `standalone-doc'.

 * Included the file `pt.tex' from the 17 Jun 99 version of the
   `acedoc' directory, adding the following lines:

 * `ace3001.tex' modified to input `pt.tex' at the same place
   that it was input in the 17 Jun 99 version of the `acedoc' 
   directory, adding the following lines:

     % PROOF TABLE
   
     \chapter{Proof Tables}
   
     \input{pt}

 * Modified `report.cls' and `size12.clo' underwent a namechange;
   they are now called: `repcram.cls' and `cramsz12.clo',
   respectively. Consequently, `repcram.cls' was modified to
   input `cramsz12.clo' rather than `size12.clo'. The reason
   for the name changes, is that modification of LaTeX class/
   class option/package files is *only* permitted if the file-
   names are also changed. Also, all uses of the word `standard'
   were deleted ... again this word is reserved for the official
   base LaTeX class/class option/package files.

 * `ace3001.tex' modified to use the `repcram.cls' rather than
   `report.cls' (changing `report' to `repcram' in line ):

     \documentclass[12pt,a4paper,twoside]{report}
                                             ^^^
   and some comments at the top of the file were changed in line with this.

 * `Alternate' replaced by `Alternative' in al2.tex:

     Alternate forms of a command are separated by a \ttt{/}\kern-1pt, while
             ^
