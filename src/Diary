- all (existing) DTT (Debug/Test/Trace) code removed.
- New header/comment style introduced, with source code width changed to 78 
  chars.
- ACE_VER changed to ACEVER & to 4.000.
- AL1_BINARY flag removed, and workspace multipliers fixed as decimal.
- manual; basic changes from ACE 3.000 to ACE 4.xxx (aka Ver 4.0 Rel 00)

6 Sep 03

- AL2_HINFO flag removed, and machine name p/out removed.  Note added to sys
  cmd about using "uname -n" instead.
- SLLI flag removed.
- AL0_CC & AL0_DD flags removed.  So coincs & dedns are included in the action
  cnt for messaging.
- the "hole limit" cmd was removed, as were -ve values for the "message" cmd.
  So were all occurrences of the "hlimit" & "msghol" variables.  The 
  al0_nholes() fn was retained, for the time being.  The -257 rtn value is now
  unused.  The MSGMID macro was deleted, and its printout done inline.
- removed AL0_STAT flag, statistics cmd & entire statistics package.
- the `place-holders' for the old "par[ameter]" & "restart" cmds were deleted.

7 Sep 03

- the "ti[me limit]" cmd & the tlimit variable were removed.  The -258 rtn 
  value is now unused. 
- the "dump" cmd & all its fns were removed.
- the "ai" & "ao" cmds were removed.  The fip/fop FILE* were removed, and all
  i/o done via stdin/stdout.  stderr is *not* used anywhere.

10 Sep 03

- reorganised make file to work with object files
- split parser.c into parser.c & cmdloop.c
- all the error handlers moved into ace.c
- the enum0x.c files changed to enum0x.inc `include' files
- the SWAP macro was removed, and swaps done directly

12 Sep 03

- sorted stupid error introduced on 10th (cf SWAP macro)
- gave things a bit of a work-out, as a check-up!
- tidied up some of the example/demo files

13 Sep 03

- further testing & demo file workout

19 Sep 03

- tidied up some of the sources
- bit the bullet, and started on the long long & packed stuff
- did all the CTentry stuff

20 Sep 03

- did some testing, using 24/32/40 bits.  32 seems more or less to match old
  ACE (good, we were hoping this would be the case).  Both 24/40 slower, with
  40 worse than 24 (reasonable, more bytes to shuffle); the speed penalty can
  get up to ~x2 (hmm).  Memory usage is what we'd expect.

22 Sep 03

- tinkered with Coset (ex StdInt) & Entry (ex CTentry) code
- introduced Coset printf kludge; ie, #define P ...
- started working through source, introducing Coset (& tidying-up)
  ... al2.h, enum00.inc, ace.c
- changed workspace allocations/manipulations to include (size_t) casts
- retuned o/p format/width

23 Sep 03

- more code tinkering & testing
- started working on al1.h

24 Sep 03

- worked thro' ... al1.h, util1.c
- reworking & tested CT printing (still needs mulling over!)

25 Sep 03

- working thro' ... util2.c

26 Sep 03

- removed strdup(), and reworked grpname/subgrpname code
- storm stopped play ...

27 Sep 03

- tidied-up grpname/subgrpname stuff
- moved outlen() to postproc.c
- worked thro' ... util2.c
- started on ... parser.c

28 Sep 03

- completed ... parser.c

29 Sep 03

- further testing & demo file workout
- worked through ... enum02.inc, enum01.inc
- removed BTINT macro

30 Sep 03

- finished moving all #include's about, and paring to the minimum
- started on ... cmdloop.c

2 Oct 03

- continued ... cmdloop.c

4 Oct 03

- completed ... cmdloop.c
- started ... al0.h
- changed P macro to C
- introduced SInt & BInt types, and S & B macros
- al0_date() moved to ace.c & renamed datetime()

6 Oct 03

- continued ... al0.h

7 Oct 03

- finished ... al0.h
- all extant "long long" changed to BInt
- PMode deleted, and replaced with PDef flg (Logic); mode 3 code retained as
  the TRUE code, rest deleted; help & other code altered;

8 Oct 03

- updated ... util0.c, coinc.c
- did some work on the test i/p files, and did some testing
- started on ... control.c

11 Oct 03

- did some work on the manual
- completed ... control.c, postproc.c

12 Oct 03

- completed ... enum.c
- sorted out types in enum01/02
- added missing `break' for state 58 at state-machine exit!
- all src code now updated for Coset type (still some BInt/SInt stuff), and 
  compiles without *any* warnings (on my home box).

18 Oct 03

- did some work on manual
- tidied up various files in the ~/ace4/ tree
- sorted warning due to sizeof() type
- tidied up some source files

20 Oct 03

- removed some errant "lld" in printf cmds
- did some work on manual
- moved some `int' types to `SInt'
- tabsiz changed to BInt type
- changed NEXTPD macro (to prevent some compilers whinging)

25 Oct 03

- makefile (THE)DATE macro deleted, used __DATE__/__TIME__ instead.  Put note
  in doco re "util2.o", not executable.
- worked through, checking types ... al2.h, ace.c, util2.c, enum01.inc,
  enum00.inc

27 Oct 03

- finally sorted-out test020.in problem (typo in presn)
- worked through ... util0.c, enum02.inc

1 Nov 03

- did some manual work
- worked through ... al1.h, al0.h, control.c, util1.c, cmdloop.c, parser.c,
  coinc.c, postproc.c, enum.c.  All variable/fns now correctly typed (I hope),
  and embarrassing fungus crash sorted!
- made all `local' fns static

2 Nov 03

- macroised choices for BInt/SInt & Coset/Entry.  Tested the modes, and 
  sorted out some type conflicts.
