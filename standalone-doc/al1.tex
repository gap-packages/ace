\ace\ Level $0$ is a complete, efficient coset enumerator.
However, it is `naked'\kern-1.5pt, in the sense that it expects all its 
  data structures to be correctly setup and it assumes that it is
  `sensibly' driven.
\ace\ Level $1$ is a simple wrapper for Level $0$ which processes the 
  presentation and the parameters, and sets up the appropriate data
  structures.
It contains some utility routines to help drive \ace, and it prevents some
  of the more obvious errors.
Although it has to be used with care, the wrapper is a great deal easier to
  drive than the core enumerator, and is its recommended interface.
