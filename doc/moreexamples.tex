\Chapter{Finer Points with Examples}

The examples in this chapter  are  intended  to  provide  the  nearest
{\GAP} equivalent of the similarly named  sections  in  Appendix~A  of
`ace3001.ps' (the standalone manual  in  directory  `standalone-doc').
There is a *lot* of detail here, which the novice {\ACE} Package  user
won't want to know about.  Please,  despite  the  name  of  the  first
section of this chapter,  read  the  examples  in  Appendix~"Examples"
first.

\Section{Getting Started}

Each     of     the      functions      `ACECosetTableFromGensAndRels'
(see~"ACECosetTableFromGensAndRels"), `ACEStats'  (see~"ACEStats"  ---
non-interactive  version)  and  `ACEStart'  (see~"ACEStart"),  may  be
called with three arguments: <fgens> (the  group  generators),  <rels>
(the group relators), and <sgens> (the subgroup generators). While  it
is legal for the arguments <rels> and <sgens> to be empty lists, it is
always an error for <fgens> to be empty, e.g.

\beginexample
gap> ACEStats([],[],[]);

  activecosets := 499998, maxcosets := 499998, totcosets := 499998 )

The example shows that the {\ACE} package does allow  you  to  recover
from the `break'-loop. However, the definition  of  `fgens'  above  is
local to  the  `break'-loop,  and  in  any  case  we  shall  want  two
generators for the examples we wish to consider and raise  some  other
points; so let us re-define `fgens' and start again:

\beginexample
gap> F := FreeGroup("a", "b");; fgens := FreeGeneratorsOfFpGroup(F);;

*An `ACEStats' example*

By  default,  the  presentation  is  not  echoed;   use   the   `echo'
(see~"option echo") option if you want that.  Also,  by  default,  the
{\ACE} binary only prints a *results message*, but we won't  see  that
unless   we   set   `InfoACE'   to   a   level   of   at    least    2
(see~"InfoACE"):

\beginexample
gap> SetInfoLevel(InfoACE, 2);

\endexample

Calling `ACEStats' with arguments `fgens', `[]', `[]', defines a  free
froup with 2 generators, since the second argument  defines  an  empty
relator list; and since  the  third  argument  is  an  empty  list  of
generators, the  subgroup  defined  is  trivial.  So  the  enumeration
overflows:

\beginexample
gap> ACEStats(fgens, [], []);
#I  OVERFLOW (a=249998 r=83333 h=83333 n=249999; l=337 c=0.10; m=249998 t=2499\
98)
rec( index := 0, cputime := 10, cputimeUnits := "10^-2 seconds", 
  activecosets := 249998, maxcosets := 249998, totcosets := 249998 )

\endexample

The  line  starting  with   ```\#I  '''.  is  the  `Info'-ed  *results
message* from {\ACE};  see  Appendix~"The  Meanings  of  ACE's  Output
Messages" for details  on  what  it  means.  Observe  that  since  the
enumeration overflowed, {\ACE}'s result message  has  been  translated
into a {\GAP} record with `index' field 0.

To dump  out  the  presentation  and  parameters  associated  with  an
enumeration,  {\ACE}  provides  the  `sr'  (see~"option  sr")  option.
However, you won't see output of this  command,  unless  you  set  the
`InfoACE' level to at least 3. Also, to ensure the reliability  of  the
output of the `sr' option, an enumeration  should  *precede*  it;  for
`ACEStats' (and `ACECosetTableFromGensAndRels') the directive  `start'
(see~"option start") required to initiate an enumeration  is  inserted
(automatically) after all the  user's  options,  except  if  the  user
herself supplies an option that initiates an enumeration (namely,  one
of `start' or `begin' (see~"option start"), `aep'  (see~"option  aep")
or `rep' (see~"option rep")). Interactively,  the  equivalent  of  the
`sr' command is `ACEParameters' (see~"ACEParameters"), which gives  an
output record that is immediately {\GAP}-usable.  With  the  above  in
mind let's  rerun  the  enumeration  and  get  {\ACE}'s  dump  of  the
presentation and parameters:

Observe that at `InfoACE' level 3, one also gets {\ACE}'s  banner.  We
could have printed out the first few lines of the coset  table  if  we
had wished, using the `print' (see~"option print") option, but note as
with the `sr' option, an enumeration should *precede* it. Here's  what
happens if you disregard this (recall, we  still  have  the  `InfoACE'
level set to 3):

\beginexample

\endexample

Essentially, because {\ACE} had  not  done  an  enumeration  prior  to
getting the `print' directive, it complained with an  ```**  ERROR''',
recovered  and  went  on  with  the  `start'  directive  automatically
inserted by the `ACEStats' command:  no  ill  effects  at  the  {\GAP}
level, but also no table.

Now, let's do what we should have done (to get those first  few  lines
of the coset table), namely, insert  the  `start'  option  before  the
`print' option (the `InfoACE' level is still 3):

The values we gave to the `print' option, told  {\ACE}  to  print  the
first 12 lines and include coset  representatives.  Note  that,  since
there are no relators, the table has separate  columns  for  generator
inverses. So the default workspace of $1000000$ words allows  a  table
of $249998 = 1000000/4 - 2$ cosets. Since row  `fill'ing  (see~"option
fill") is on by default, the table is simply  filled  with  cosets  in
order. Note that a compaction phase is done before printing the table,
but that this does nothing here (the lowercase `co:' tag), since there
are no dead cosets. The coset representatives are simply all  possible
freely reduced words, in length plus lexicographic (i.e. `lenlex'; see
Section~"Coset Table Standardisation Schemes") order.

*Using `ACECosetTableFromGensAndRels'*

The  essential  difference  between  the  functions   `ACEStats'   and
`ACECosetTableFromGensAndRels' is that `ACEStats' parses the  *results
message* from the {\ACE} binary and outputs a {\GAP} record containing
statistics  of  the  enumeration,  and  `ACECosetTableFromGensAndRels'
after parsing the *results message*, goes on to parse  {\ACE}'s  coset
table, if it can, and outputs a {\GAP} list of lists version  of  that
table. So, if we had used  `ACECosetTableFromGensAndRels'  instead  of
`ACEStats' in our examples  above,  we  would  have  observed  similar
output, except that we would have ended up in a `break'-loop  (because
the enumeration overflows) instead of obtaining  a  record  containing
enumeration statistics. We have already seen an  example  of  that  in
Section~"Using ACE Directly to Generate a Coset Table".  So,  here  we
will consider two options that prevent one  entering  a  `break'-loop,
namely   the   `silent'   (see~"option   silent")   and   `incomplete'
(see~"option  incomplete")  options.  Firstly,  let's  take  the  last
`ACEStats' example, but use `ACECosetTableFromGensAndRels' instead and
include the `silent' option. (We still have the `InfoACE' level set at
3.)

fail

\endexample

Since, the enumeration overflowed and the  `silent'  option  was  set,
`ACECosetTableFromGensAndRels' simply returned `fail'.  But  hang  on,
{\ACE} at least has a partial table; we should be able to obtain it in
{\GAP} format, in a situation like this. We can.  We  simply  use  the
`incomplete' option, instead of the `silent' option.  However,  if  we
did that with the example above, the result would be an enormous table
(the number of *active cosets* is 249998); so  let  us  also  set  the
`max' (see~"option max") option, in order that we should  get  a  more
modestly sized partial table. Finally, we  will  use  `print  :=  -12'
since it is a shorter equivalent alternative to `print :=  [-1,  12]'.
Note that the output here was obtained with {\GAP}  4.3  (and  is  the
same with {\GAP} 4.4).

*Note:* Sinec the order options are passed to {\ACE} behind the colon,
has  not been honoured since {\GAP} 4.5 (at about the time {\ACE}  5.1
was released in 2012), the  behaviour  exhibited  below is  no  longer 
observed. To approximately  get  the behaviour below,  omit the option
`start'.  This option is inserted  anyway,  if  a user  omits it,  and 
importantly is inserted after the `max' option is  put  to  the {\ACE}
binary.

Observe, that despite the fact that {\ACE} is  able  to  define  coset
representatives for all 12 coset numbers  defined,  the  body  of  the
coset table now contains a 0 at each  place  formerly  occupied  by  a
coset number larger than 12 (0 essentially represents ``don't know'').
To get a table that is the same in the first  12  rows  as  before  we
would have had to set `max' to 38, since that was  the  largest  coset
number that appeared in the body of  the  12-line  table,  previously.
Also, note that the `max' option *preceded* the `start' option;  since
the interface respects the order in which options are put by the user,
the enumeration invoked by `start'  would  otherwise  have  only  been
restricted by the size of `workspace'  (see~"option  workspace").  The
warning that the coset table is incomplete is emitted at `InfoACE'  or
`InfoWarning' level 1, i.e.~by default, you will see it.

\atindex{ACEStart}{@\noexpand`ACEStart'!example}
*Using `ACEStart'*

The     limitation     of     the     functions     `ACEStats'     and
`ACECosetTableFromGensAndRels' (on three arguments) is  that  they  do
not *interact* with {\ACE}; they call {\ACE} with user-defined  input,
and collect and parse the output for  either  statistics  or  a  coset
table. On the other hand,  the  `ACEStart'  (see~"ACEStart")  function
allows one to start up an {\ACE} process and maintain a dialogue  with
it. Moreover, via the functions `ACEStats' and `ACECosetTable'  (on  1
or no arguments), one is able to extract the same information that  we
could with the non-interactive versions of these  functions.  However,
we can also do a lot more. Each {\ACE}  option  that  provides  output
that can be used from within {\GAP} has  a  corresponding  interactive
interface function that parses and translates that output into a  form
usable from within {\GAP}.

Now we emulate our  (successful)  `ACEStats'  exchanges  above,  using
interactive  {\ACE}  interface  functions.  We  could  do  this  with:
`ACEStart(0, fgens, [], [] : start, sr := 1);'  where  the  `0'  first
argument tells `ACEStart' not to  insert  `start'  after  the  options

Observe that the `ACEStart' call returned an integer (1, here). All  8
forms of the `ACEStart' function, return an  integer  that  identifies
the interactive {\ACE} interface function  initiated  or  communicated
with. We may use this integer to tell any interactive {\ACE} interface
function which interactive {\ACE} process we wish to communicate with.
Above we passed `1' to the `ACEParameters' command which caused `sr :=
1' (see~"option sr") to be passed to the  interactive  {\ACE}  process
indexed by 1 (the process we just started), and  a  record  containing
the parameter options (see~"ACEParameterOptions")  is  returned.  Note
that the ``Run Parameters'': `Group Generators', `Group Relators'  and
`Subgroup Generators' are considered ``args'' (i.e.~arguments)  and  a
record   containing   these   is   returned   by   the    `GetACEArgs'
(see~"GetACEArgs") command; or they may be obtained  individually  via
the   commands:    `ACEGroupGenerators'    (see~"ACEGroupGenerators"),
`ACERelators'    (see~"ACERelators"),    or    `ACESubgroupGenerators'
(see~"ACESubgroupGenerators").

We can obtain the enumeration statistics record, via  the  interactive
version of `ACEStats' (see~"ACEStats!interactive") :

\beginexample
gap> ACEStats(1); # The interactive version of ACEStats takes 1 or no arg'ts
rec( index := 0, cputime := 10, cputimeUnits := "10^-2 seconds", 
  activecosets := 249998, maxcosets := 249998, totcosets := 249998 )

\endexample

To display 12 lines of the  coset  table  with  coset  representatives
without invoking a further enumeration we could do: `ACEStart(0,  1  :
print   :=   [-1,   12]);'.   Alternatively,   we    may    use    the
`ACEDisplayCosetTable' (see~"ACEDisplayCosetTable") (the table  itself
is emitted at `InfoACE' level 1, since by default we  presumably  want
to see it):

\beginexample

Still with the same interactive {\ACE} process we can now emulate  the
`ACECosetTableFromGensAndRels' exchange that  gave  us  an  incomplete
coset table. Note that it is still necessary to invoke an  enumeration
after setting the `max' (see~"option max") option. We could just  call
`ACECosetTable' with the argument 1 and the same 4 options we used for
`ACECosetTableFromGensAndRels'.   Alternatively,   we   can   do   the
equivalent of the 4  options  one  (or  two)  at  a  time,  via  their
equivalent interactive commands.  Note  that  the  `ACEStart'  command
(without `0' as first argument) inserts a `start' directive after  the
user option `max':

\beginexample
gap> ACEStart(1 : max := 12);
#I  ***
#I  OVERFLOW (a=12 r=4 h=4 n=13; l=5 c=0.00; m=12 t=12)

Now the following `ACEDisplayCosetTable' command does  the  equivalent

Finally, we call `ACECosetTable' with 1 argument  (which  invokes  the

Observe the line beginning ```\#I start = yes,'''  (the  first line in
the output of `ACECosetTable'). This line appears in response  to  the
option `mode' (see~"option mode") inserted  by  `ACECosetTable'  after
any user options; it is inserted  in  order  to  check  that  no  user
options  (possibly  made  before  the   `ACECosetTable'   call)   have
invalidated {\ACE}'s coset table. Since the line also says `continue =
yes', the mode `continue' (the least expensive  of  the  three  modes;
see~"option continu") is directed at {\ACE} which  evokes  a  *results
message*. Then `ACECosetTable' extracts the  incomplete  table  via  a
`print' (see "option print") directive. If you wish  to  see  all  the
options that are directed to {\ACE}, set  the  `InfoACE'  level  to  4
(then all such commands are `Info'-ed behind a ```ToACE>  '''  prompt;
see~"InfoACE").

Following the standalone manual, we  now  set  things  up  to  do  the
alternating group $A_5$, of order $60$. (We saw the group  $A_5$  with
subgroup $C_5$ earlier in Section~"Example of Using ACE  Interactively
(Using ACEStart)"; here we are concerned with observing and  remarking
on the output from the {\ACE} binary.) We turn messaging  on  via  the
`messages' (see~"option messages") option;  setting  `messages'  to  1
tells {\ACE} to emit a *progress message* on each  pass  of  its  main
loop. In the example following we set `messages := 1000',  which,  for
our example, sets the interval between messages so high that  we  only
get the ``Run Parameters'' block (the same as that obtained  with  `sr
:= 1'), no progress messages and the final *results  message*.  Recall
`F' is the free group we defined  on  generators  `fgens':  `"a"'  and
`"b"'. Here we will be interested in seeing what is transmitted to the
{\ACE} binary; so we will set  the  `InfoACE'  level  to  4  (what  is
transmitted to {\ACE} will now appear behind a  ```ToACE> '''  prompt,
and we will still see the messages *from*  {\ACE}).  Note,  that  when
{\GAP}  prints  `F.1'  ($=$  `fgens[1]')  it  displays  `a',  but  the
*variable* `a' is (at the moment) unassigned; so for  convenience  (in
defining relators, for example) we first assign the variable `a' to be
`F.1' (and `b' to be `F.2').

Observe that the `fgens' and  subgroup  generators  (the  empty  list)
arguments are transmitted to {\ACE} via the  {\ACE}  binary's  `group'
and `generators' options, respectively. Observe also, that the relator
`(a*b)^5'  is  expanded  by  {\GAP}  to   `a*b*a*b*a*b*a*b*a*b'   when
transmitted to {\ACE} and then  {\ACE}  correctly  deduces  that  it's
`(a*b)^5'.

Since we  did  not  specify  a  strategy  the  `default'  (see~"option
default") strategy was followed and  hence  coset  number  definitions
were R (i.e.~HLT) style, and a total of $76$  coset  numbers  (`t=76')
were defined (if we had tried `felsch' we would have achieved the best
possible: `t=60').  Note,  that  {\ACE}  already  ``knew''  the  group
generators  and  subgroup  generators;  so,  we  could  have   avoided
re-transmitting that information by using the `relators'  (see~"option
relators") option:

Note the usage  of  `ToACEWords'  (see~"ToACEWords")  to  provide  the
appropriate string value of the `relators' option. Also,  observe  the
`Info'-ed warning of the action  triggered  by  using  the  `relators'
option, that says that the current values of the  ``args''  (i.e.~what
would be returned by `GetACEArgs'; see~"GetACEArgs")  were  discarded,
which immediately triggered the action of reinstantiating the value of
`ACEData.io[1].args' (which is what the `Info':

\begintt
#I  No group generators saved. Setting value(s) from ACE ...
\endtt

was all about). Also observe that the  ``Run  Parameters''  block  was
`Info'-ed twice; the first time was due to  `ACEStart'  emitting  `sr'
with  value  `1'  to  {\ACE},  the  response  of  which  is  used   to
re-instantiate `ACEData.io[1].args', and the second is in response  to
transmitting `Start' to {\ACE}.


In  particular,  {\GAP}  no  longer  thinks  `fgens'  are  the   group
generators:

\beginexample
gap> ACEGroupGenerators(1) = fgens;
false

\endexample

Groan! We will just have to re-instantiate everything:

\beginexample
gap> fgens := ACEGroupGenerators(1);;
gap> F := GroupWithGenerators(fgens);; a := F.1;; b := F.2;;

\endexample

We now define a non-trivial subgroup, of small enough index,  to  make
the observation of all progress messages, by setting `messages :=  1',
a not too onerous proposition. As for defining the relators, we  could
use the 1-argument version of `ACEStart', in which case we  would  use
the  `subgroup'  (see~"option  subgroup")  option   with   the   value
`ToACEWords(fgens, [ a*b ])'. However, as we saw, in the end we  don't
save anything by doing this, since afterwards the  variables  `fgens',
`a', `b' and `F' would no longer be associated with `ACEStart' process
1. Instead, we will use the more convenient 4-argument form, and  also
switch the `InfoACE' level back to 3:

value  of  the  relators  we  had  defined  earlier.  We   also   used
`ACEGroupGenerators(1)' (see~"ACEGroupGenerators") to  get  the  group
generators.

The  run  ended  with  12  active   (see   Section~"Coset   Statistics
Terminology") coset numbers (`a=12') after defining a total number  of
15 coset numbers (`t=15'); the definitions occurred at the steps  with
progress messages tagged by `AD:' (coset 1 application definition) and
`SG:' (subgroup generator phase), and the 13 tagged by `RD:' (R  style
definition). So there must have  been  3  coincidences:  observe  that
there were 3 progress messages with a `CC:'  tag.  (See  Appendix~"The
Meanings of ACE's Output Messages".)

We can dump out the  statistics  accumulated  during  the  run,  using
`ACEDumpStatistics'  (see~"ACEDumpStatistics"),  which   `Info's   the
{\ACE}  output  of  the  `statistics'  (see~"option  statistics")   at
`InfoACE' level 1.

The statistic `qcoinc=3' states what we had already observed,  namely,
that there  were  three  coincidences.  Of  these,  two  were  primary
coincidences  (`rdcoinc=2').  Since  `t=15',   there   were   fourteen
non-trivial coset number definitions; one was during  the  application
of coset 1 to the subgroup generator (`apdefn=1'), and  the  remainder
occurred during applications of the  coset  numbers  to  the  relators
(`rddefn=13'). For more details on the meanings of the  variables  you
will need to read the C code comments.

Now let us display  all  12  lines  of  the  coset  table  with  coset
representatives.

Note  how  the  pre-printout  compaction  phase  now  does  some  work
(indicated  by  the  upper-case   `CO:'   tag),   since   there   were
coincidences, and hence dead coset numbers. Note how `b' and `B'  head
the first two columns,  since  {\ACE}  requires  that  the  first  two
columns  be  occupied  by  a  generator/inverse  pair  or  a  pair  of
involutions. The `a' column is also the  `A'  column,  as  `a'  is  an
involution.

We now use `ACEStandardCosetNumbering' to produce a `lenlex'  standard
table within {\ACE}, but note that this is only `lenlex' with  respect
to  the  ordering   `b, a'   of   the   generators.   Then   we   call
`ACEDisplayCosetTable' again to see  it.  Observe  that  at  both  the
standardisation and coset table display steps a  compaction  phase  is
invoked but on both occasions the lowercase `co:' tag  indicates  that
nothing is done (all the recovery of dead coset numbers that could  be
done was done earlier).

Of course, the table above is not `lenlex' with respect to  the  order
of the generators we had originally given to {\ACE}; to get  that,  we
would have needed to specify `lenlex'  (see~"option  lenlex")  at  the
enumeration  stage.  The  effect  of  the  `lenlex'  option   at   the
enumeration stage is the following: behind the scenes it ensures  that
the relator `a^2' is passed to {\ACE} as `aa' and  then  it  sets  the
option `asis' to 1; this bit of skulduggery stops {\ACE} treating  `a'
as an involution, allowing `a' and `A' (the inverse of `a') to take up
the first two columns of the coset table, effectively stopping  {\ACE}
from reordering the generators. To see what is passed  to  {\ACE},  at
the enumeration stage, we set the `InfoACE' level to 4,  but  since  we
don't really want to see messages this time we set `messages := 0'.

You may have noticed the use of {\ACE}'s `text' option  several  times
above; this just tells {\ACE} to print the argument  given  to  `text'
(as a comment). This is used by the {\GAP} interface  as  a  sentinel;
when the string appears in the {\ACE}  output,  the  {\GAP}  interface
knows not to expect anything else.

\Section{Emulating Sims}

Here we consider the various `sims'  strategies  (see~"option  sims"),
with respect to duplicating Sims' example statistics of his strategies
given in Section 5.5 of \cite{Sim94}, and giving approximations of his
even-numbered strategies.

In order to duplicate Sims' maximum active  coset  numbers  and  total
coset numbers statistics, one needs to work with the  formal  inverses
of the relators  and  subgroup  generators  from  \cite{Sim94},  since
definitions are made from the front in Sims'  routines  and  from  the
rear      in      {\ACE}.      Also,      in      instances      where
`IsACEGeneratorsInPreferredOrder(<gens>, <rels>)' returns `false', for
group generators <fgens> and relators <rels>, one will need  to  apply
the `lenlex' option to stop {\ACE} from re-ordering the generators and
relators (see~"IsACEGeneratorsInPreferredOrder" and~"option  lenlex").
In general, we can match Sims' values for the `sims := 1' and `sims :=
3' strategies  (the  R  style  and  R\*  style  Sims  strategies  with
`mendelsohn' off) and for the `sims :=  9'  (C  style)  strategy,  but
sometimes we may not exactly match Sims' statistics for the  `sims  :=
5' and `sims :=  7'  strategies  (the  R  style  and  R\*  style  Sims
strategies with `mendelsohn' on); Sims does not specify an  order  for
the (Mendelsohn) processing of cycled relators and evidently  {\ACE}'s
processing order is different  to  the  one  Sims  used  in  his  CHLT
algorithm to get his statistics (see~"option mendelsohn").

*Note:* 
HLT as it appears in Table 5.5.1 of \cite{Sim94} is achieved in {\ACE}
with the sequence ```hlt, lookahead  :=  0'''  and  CHLT  is  (nearly)
equivalent to  ```hlt,  lookahead  :=  0,  mendelsohn''';  also  Sims'
`<save> = false' equates to R style (`rt'  positive,  `ct  :=  0')  in
{\ACE}, and `<save> = true', for Sims' HLT and CHLT,  equates  to  R\*
style (`rt' negative, `ct := 0')  in  {\ACE}.  Sims'  Felsch  strategy
coincides with {\ACE}'s `felsch := 0' strategy, i.e.~`sims  :=  9'  is
identical to `felsch := 0'. (See  the  options~"option  hlt",  "option
lookahead", "option mendelsohn", "option ct", "option rt"  and~"option
felsch".)

The following duplicates the ``Total''  (`totcosets'  in  {\ACE})  and
``Max.~Active'' (`maxcosets' in {\ACE}) statistics for Example~5.2  of
\cite{Sim94},  found  in  Sims'  Table~5.5.3,  for  the  `sims  :=  3'
strategy.

By replacing `sims := 3' with `sims := <i>' for <i> equal to~1,  5,  7
or~9, one may verify that for <i> equal to~1  or~9,  Sims'  statistics
are again  duplicated,  and  observe  a  slight  variance  with  Sims'
statistics for <i> equal to~5 or~7.

Now, we show how one can approximate any one of  Sims'  even-numbered
strategies. Essentially, the idea is to start  an  interactive  {\ACE}
process using `ACEStart' (see~"ACEStart") with `sims := <i>', for  <i>
equal to~1, 3, 5, 7 or~9, and `max' set to some low  value  <maxstart>
so that the enumeration stops after only completing a few rows of  the
coset table. Then, to  approximate  Sims'  strategy  `<i>  +  1',  one
alternately  applies  `ACEStandardCosetNumbering'  and  `ACEContinue',
progressively increasing the value of `max' by some  value  <maxstep>.
The general  algorithm  is  provided  by  the  `ACEEvenSims'  function
following.

\beginexample
gap> ACEEvenSims := function(fgens, rels, sgens, i, maxstart, maxstep)
>      local j;
>      j := ACEStart(fgens, rels, sgens : sims := i, max := maxstart);
>      while ACEStats(j).index = 0 do
>        ACEStandardCosetNumbering(j);
>        ACEContinue(j : max := ACEParameters(j).max + maxstep);
>      od;
>      return ACEStats(j);
>    end;;

\endexample

It turns out that one can duplicate the Sims' strategy 4 statistics in
Table~5.5.3 of \cite{Sim94}, with `<i> = 3' (so that `<i> + 1  =  4'),
`<maxstart> = 14' and `<maxstep> = 50':

\beginexample
gap> ACEEvenSims([r, s, t], [(r^t*r^-2)^-1, (s^r*s^-2)^-1, (t^s*t^-2)^-1],
>                [], 3, 14, 50);
rec( index := 1, cputime := 0, cputimeUnits := "10^-2 seconds", 
  activecosets := 1, maxcosets := 393, totcosets := 393 )

\endexample

Setting `<maxstep> = 60' (and leaving the other parameters  the  same)
also gives Sims' statistics, but `<maxstart> = 64' with  `<maxstep>  =
80' does better:

\beginexample
gap> ACEEvenSims([r, s, t], [(r^t*r^-2)^-1, (s^r*s^-2)^-1, (t^s*t^-2)^-1],
>                [], 3, 64, 80);
rec( index := 1, cputime := 0, cputimeUnits := "10^-2 seconds", 
  activecosets := 1, maxcosets := 352, totcosets := 352 )

\endexample

Even though the (`lenlex') standardisation steps in the above examples
produce a significant improvement over the  `sims  :=  3'  statistics,
this  does  not  happen  universally.  Sims  \cite{Sim94}  gives  many
examples  where  the  even-numbered  strategies  fail  to   show   any
significant improvement over  the  odd-numbered  strategies,  and  one
example (see~Table~5.5.7) where `sims := 2' gives a  performance  that
is very much worse than any of the other Sims strategies. As with  any
of the strategies, what works well for some groups may not work at all
well with other groups. There are *no* general rules. It's a bit of  a
game. Let's hope you win most of the time.
