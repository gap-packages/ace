    - Notes about bug placed in above files.
      In documentation these are in sections 1.11, 4.4, C.1 (ahead of
      example dated Wed Oct 31 09:41:14 2001)
  * PackageInfo.g,doc/install.tex
    - Max Horn listed as co-maintainer.
    - Now list dependence as requiring GAP version >= 4.7.
  * PackageInfo.g,doc/{{ace,install}.tex,manual.bib},src/al[012].h,

      George Havas and ACE 3.001.
  * doc/manual.bib
    - some references now in the main .bib file
  * doc/manual.tex
    - two \def s added to ensure GAP's manualbib.xml.bib (prev. manual.bib)
      is compatible with gapmacro compilation.
  * doc/install.tex
    - changed Reference manual reference to `gap.ini` and `gaprc` files,
      from `.gaprc` file.
    - removed reference to `make_doc`, which is not included in
      downloadable archives.
  * doc/{ace,install,options}.tex:
    - added blank line before each \endexample line, to account for
      changed behaviour which was not tabbing the last line of an example
  * PackageInfo.g,README,VERSION,doc/{manual,ace,install}.tex:
    - routine changes
  * tst/aceds.tst
    - Info lines in example only appear when `InfoACE` is set to 3.
      This has been wrong for a while. It was wrong in Version 5.0.

      at this `InfoACE` level. These and some further tidy-ups done.

## Version 5.1 (2012-01-22)

  * make_zoo,pack_pkg:
    - make_zoo is deprecated
    - (newly created) pack_pkg now creates a tar.gz archive

## Version 4.0
  Revised for GAP 4.4. Not given general release.
  * init.g 
    - for GAP 4.3 compatibility, if GAP 4.3 then 
      `GAPInfo` record defined with entries:

        . `Version` which is defined to be the contents VERSION

## Version 3.003
  * Initial value of `ACEIgnoreUnknownDefault` is now  `true`  (previously
    it was `false`).

  * `ACECosetTableFromGensAndRels` and the non-interactive
    `ACECosetTable` (except when producing an input script via  option 
    `ACEinfile`),  and the non-interactive `ACEStats` which previously 
    used  files  all  now invoke iostreams.
