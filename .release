# Copy some HTML files to work around an old bug in the old GAP
# documentation system. For details, please refer to
# <https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues/4430>.
#
# Note: we used to create symlinks instead of copying the files, which
# seems conceptually cleaner, but caused breakage in the GAP release
# process. Figuring out the details does not seem worth the hassle, so
# just copy the files instead. For details, please refer to
